# ArduinoSensorKit
Collection of code for Arduino sensors that can be used to measure indoor climate.

Mainly uses the following sensors:
DHT_11 (Temperature and Humidity)
T18B20 (Temperature)
Small/Big Sound
SW-420 (Shock)
KY-002 (Shock)

The code is neither giving precise results, due to the nature of the sensors, nor complete.
This is just an example to show how multiple sensors can be combined in a single program to measures indoor climate values like temperature, humidity, light, noise and vibrations.

This repository contains many more sensor libraries that might be useful when implementing a new project.
